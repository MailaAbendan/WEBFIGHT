# WEBFIGHT Program

## Overview
The WEBFIGHT program is a Python script that simulates uploading a website and then opens the specified website in your default web browser. It includes a progress counter to indicate the simulated upload process in real-time.

## Features
- Prompts the user to input a website name (e.g., `AHH.com`).
- Displays a simulated upload progress bar from 1 to 100%.
- Automatically opens the specified website in the default web browser once the process is complete.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `webbrowser` and `time` modules (both included in the Python standard library).

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Python script using the command:
3. When prompted, enter the website URL you'd like to upload (e.g., `example.com`).
4. Watch the progress bar as the script simulates the upload process.
5. Once the upload is complete, the specified website will open in your default web browser.

## Example Interaction
After completion, the website `https://example.com` will open in your browser.

## Notes
- Ensure you enter a valid website URL (e.g., `example.com` or `mysite.org`).
- This program is for simulation purposes only; it does not actually upload files to any server.
